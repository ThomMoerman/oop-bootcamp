# oop-bootcamp
This repository contains code examples and exercises related to object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. It covers various use cases and scenarios to demonstrate the practical application of OOP principles in PHP.

## Use Cases
### Use Case #1: Basket and Total Price Calculation with and without Classes
Simulates a basket containing bananas, apples, and bottles of wine. The use case calculates the total price and determines the tax amount for each item.

### Use Case #2: Basket with Classes, adding taxes.
Similar to Use Case #1, but implemented using classes. The use case showcases the concept of encapsulation and demonstrates the calculation of the total price and tax.

### Use Case #3: Content Types
Simulates three types of content for a website: articles, ads, and vacancies. Each content type has a title and text. The title is modified differently for each type when displayed.

### Use Case #4: Student Groups and Average Scores
Simulates two groups of students, each consisting of 10 students. The use case allows for calculating the average score of a group and moving a student from one group to another.

Feel free to explore the code and review the implementation details of each use case to gain a better understanding of OOP concepts and their practical application in PHP.
